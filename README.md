# Appointments
A short project using DOM Manipulation along with HTML and CSS.

Using this application, a user can create appointments and view it by applying sorting techniques, or changing the number of posts per page.This application gets data from a mock-server and every post a user creates, it basically appends in db.json file of mock-server and again gets it from there. It is done by using XMLHTTPRequest.
